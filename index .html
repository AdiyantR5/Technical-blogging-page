    <p>THERE IS NOTHING groundbreaking about a smartphone that can fold. Is the engineering impressive? Absolutely. Are they just plain cool? Totally. But while these devices do make certain tasks easier in some instances, they don't completely overhaul the way we use smartphones. That's been my experience with Samsung's fourth generation Galaxy Z Flip and Galaxy Z Fold.</p>
    
    <p>These folding phones feel just as unique as the original models that Samsung debuted a few years ago, but more refined and more durable. I took the Galaxy Z Flip4 to the beach and it came out unscathed by sand and salt. I love that it was tiny enough to fit in my shirt pocket too. </p>

    <p>  
        I have previously noted all the upgrades Samsung has added in the latest generation of foldables, but in short, these are all-around more durable devices. Both are speedy, thanks to the latest Qualcomm processor, and they both have wonderfully sharp screens that get plenty bright on the sunniest days.

      <em>Flex mode, where you position the hinge at a 90-degree angle, is a standout feature.</em>

        In use, the smaller Z Flip4 feels the most “normal” of these two folding phones. That’s because when it’s unfolded, you get a traditional smartphone experience. Fold it in half and it will fit in small pockets and tiny purses. It also looks cute, especially if you customize its shell colors with Samsung’s Bespoke Studio.
      </p>

      <p>
        Battery life might be one of your biggest concerns for the Flip4 since its predecessor was lacking when it came to runtimes. The 3,700-mAh capacity cell in the new model is larger and usually lasts about a full day, but not much more. It hit 10 percent by midnight on the day I took it to the beach, where I used it for photos, navigation, and reading in the sun. It's reliable enough, but heavy users might still want to bring along a portable battery.
      </p>

      <p>
        The IPX8 water-resistance rating means a drop in the pool or freshwater won’t destroy it, and I’ve yet to see a scratch on the display, which has been upgraded to be tougher than ever. When I was at the beach, I was worried some sand had gotten into the Flip4’s hinge mechanism, but it was totally fine. (You should still be careful, as the “X” in IPX8 means Samsung did not test it for dust resistance, though the lack of testing doesn’t mean it’s vulnerable).

        The 1.9-inch Cover Screen display on the Flip4—which stays visible when the phone is closed—adds more functionality this time around. It's nice not needing to open the phone for every single task. I've sent quick replies to messages from the tiny Cover Screen, used Google Pay to tap and pay at New York's subway turnstiles, and taken group photos with my fiancée and dog. (We cute.) This isn't new, but I also love that you can add GIFs as a wallpaper on the Cover Screen; naturally, this is mine. I still wouldn't mind a larger screen here in the future, so I can fully type out responses to messages and see bigger previews when I snap a photo.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of my favorite features of the Flip4 that takes advantage of its folding design is Flex Mode. Apps that support this mode, which triggers when you fold the two halves of the Flip4 into a 90-degree angle, will push some content to the top half of the screen and controls to the bottom. For example, when I hopped on a Google Duo (er, Google Meet?) video call with my brother for our weekly Smash Bros. night, all I had to do was fold the Flip4 in half and place it on the arm of my couch—my brother could see me and I could see him—I didn't have to prop it up on something else.
      </p>

      <p>
        Frankly, I haven't found many other apps that are as useful in Flex Mode, but I do like leaving my phone at a 90-degree angle when it's at my desk to browse apps like Instagram or Reddit. It's also nice for split-screening two apps; one at the top you interact with and another at the bottom to monitor passively, like tracking your late-night GrubHub order while browsing Reddit (no shame).
      </p> 

      <p>
        You can now turn the bottom half of the Flip4 into a trackpad (called Flex Mode Panel) to control an app up top, but I didn't find much of a use for this.
